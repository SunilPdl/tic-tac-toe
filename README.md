## Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking either an "X" or an "O" in an empty cell of the grid, to get three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends either when one player achieves this objective, resulting in a win, or when the grid is filled without a winner, resulting in a draw. Tic Tac Toe is known for its simplicity yet strategic depth, making it a popular choice for casual gaming and educational purposes.
